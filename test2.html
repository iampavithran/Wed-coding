     <p>A <b>JOKE</b> is a display of <mark>humour</mark> in which words are used within a specific<br>
       and well-defined narrative structure to make <i>people laugh</i> and is usually<br>
       not meant to be interpreted literally. It usually takes the form of a<br>
       story, often with dialogue, and ends in a punch line, whereby the<br>
       humorous element of the story is revealed; this can be done using a pun<br>
       or other type of word play, <sub>irony or sarcasm</sub>, <ins>logical incompatibility</ins>,<br>
       hyperbole, or other means.<sup>Linguist Robert Hetzron</sup> offers the<br>

            So we should just kiss, as a joke

            [Verse]
            Tell me that you're not catching feelings
            Cause I know I've been acting silly
            And I don't wanna go back to feeling
            Like I'm going crazy but
            I'm stupid, clueless
            And I kinda wanna do it
